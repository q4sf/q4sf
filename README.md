Hello, 

My name is Adam and I am a Business/Data Analyst

I am working on a python webscraper to collect user ticks from Mountain Project. 
The project goal is to allow users to input a CSV URL within Power BI as a pararmeter, and then Power BI will generate a custom report.
Part of this project involves scraping area names from page headings, GPS coordinates of climbing areas, and historical and future weather data.

Eventually I hope to integrate all of this information in a personal portfolio website using flask or django.
I also would like to show reports within the site using the Dash python library

So far I have learned everything on the fly. The only working knowledge I had of python when starting this project was some pandas functions and basic syntax.
